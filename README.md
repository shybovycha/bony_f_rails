# Bony-F Webserver

Bony-F is a system, transforming promotion campaigns into challenges. It hardly uses [Beacons](http://kontakt.io/) 
to send data to clients.

So, for example, if you want to gain more clients at your caffee or at your shop, you may use Bony-F.
But first, you need to match a few requirements:

1. you should have access to beacons in your city or your organization
2. you need to have an account on Bony-F website
3. you must have some bonuses to offer

Campaign consists of requirements, which need to be matched *(a challenge: visiting some places, 
buying something, etc.)* and a  bonus, user gets when completing that challenge.

Once user gets the bonus, all the requirements for that challenge are dismissed, so he needs 
to either match them again or wait for a new promo campaign to be started.

The webserver is rockin on Rails 4.2.3 and Ruby 2.2. It uses MariaDB.
